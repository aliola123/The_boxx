# THE BOXX

## Introduction
THE BOXX (https://www.mindboxx.tech), is a web application developed for a catering store which I developed for my brother (sounds nice right? Yeah, I did it to foster his business). The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few touch of python (flask) and is hosted on Nginx. I had my share of technical and non-technical dificulty using the stacks mentioned earliar; ranging from not having a deep control of JS to being unable at most point to incorporate the frontend and backend component into a single working app but it's a challenge i appreciate taking in my training as a Fullstack engineer. I had multiple sleepless night as well as moments of trying to give up but I continued anyways cause of the goal I wanted to achieve (i.e to help my brother and also to have a working project not a toy one) and it was all worth it
